# movie-recommender

It's always challenging to find new movies to watch, but it's even harder to find movies that you will actually like. Even though we have friends and family members recommending new movies all the time, some may not have the same interests or tastes. This item-based collaborative filtering system uses ratings of over 2000 movies from 378 users to recommend 10 movies based on your last watch. 

The model recommends movies based on similarity to your last watch; the similarity is measured by comparing the ratings from different users between movie A and movie B. This way, the user is recommended a movie based on other users with similar tastes, as well as highly rated movies to likely guarantee a movie the user will actually enjoy.
